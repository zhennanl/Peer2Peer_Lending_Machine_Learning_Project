# Peer-To-Peer Lending Machine Learning Project

A Python Jupyter notebook to predict the future status of Peer-to-Peer loans and develop optimal investment strategies by implementing various classification techniques. 

For this project, our team ran several classification models such as Gradient Boosting and Bagging to predict the future status of loans. Additionally, we proposed investment strategies that consider factors including the chance of a loan defaulting, the value and return of a loan, the time of the loan, and the possibility that people are delayed in their payments.
